# Automatic-Attendance-System-Using-Computer-Vision

## Introduction --> 
Hola Amigos! <br> 
This system aims to simplify the regular attendance method by automating it with the help of face recognition and saving the precious time of student and faculty. <br>
For building this system we have used various concepts of Machine Learning and DeepLearning which can be found in PPT provided in this repo. <br>
This project is completely based on <b>PYHON.</b> <br>
So if you don't have python. Don't worry you can go ahead and download it from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"> HERE </a>. <br>
Any Version above 3.6 would be a good fit.<br>
